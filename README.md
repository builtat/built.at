## 3 minutes to launch  

`built.at/your-github-username` already links to your `built.at` GitHub repository (which you can clone or create).    

## [CLONE THIS REPO](https://github.com/new?template_name=built.at&template_owner=builtat&name=built.at) 

After the `built.at` repo exists in your account you must enable GitHub Pages on the main branch. [Follow steps 6-9](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/quickstart).

## Share anything  

Landing page, portfolio, blog, notes, links - with `index.html`, `index.md`, or `index.txt` as your source.  

## Fast, Free, and Magical

**Repo template:**  
[github.com/builtat/built.at](https://github.com/builtat/built.at)  

It works to manually create a new repo called 'built.at' but it's more efficient to clone it with the link above.  

## Send a message  
hello [at] built.at
